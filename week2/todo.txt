1.Create a new html file. Add the code necessary to make it a valid document
 Add a text input and a button. Put an empty div with an ID below those.
 Add a script tag, write a function that will read the contents of the input,
  and write them to the div.
  
2.Call the function when the button is pressed.
 Modify your HTML file:
 Write a new function that expects a number as an argument. 
 It should take that number and sum all the numbers up to 
 the number provided. (ie n=5â€¦so it would do 1+2+3+4+5 = 15) 
 It should return that value.
 When the button is pressed it should read the number from the input.
  Make sure it is a valid number, call the summing 
  function you just wrote, and output the result to the div.

3.Create an adding machine
Add an additional input to your HTML file.
Add a + button.
Write a function that will take the numbers from each input,
add them together, and output the result to a div
